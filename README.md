# EDMG: Towards Efficient Long Dance Motion Generation with Fundamental Movements from Dance Genres

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

**EDMG** is a novel dance choreography framework designed to efficiently generate long, diverse, and visually pleasing dance sequences based on **music**, **dance genre**, and **fundamental movement descriptions**. It combines diffusion modeling, efficient Mamba-based denoising, and long-range smoothing techniques to produce high-quality choreography with lower computational costs.
